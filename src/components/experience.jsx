        The only experience I have is from COMP1531 creating the backend for a quiz web app. Through that I have 
        learnt about git, good git practices and how to work as a team. However, I do want more experience with 
        working as a team since I feel like it is something that I'm not fully able to properly do. I also want to 
        gain more experience with working on the frontend of an application since I feel like it is useful to have
        experience in both departments of a web app.
