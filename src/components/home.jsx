        Hi, I'm Matthew Thai. I used ___ to try and fit in with the "Opposites attract" theme. This portfolio website 
        was built using HTML, tailwindCSS and React. I'm still fairly new to this so there aren't many overly crazy 
        elements in this website. I also used Vite for the scaffolding for this website. 
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Home
